#  Medimate-AI: Multimodal Medical Diagnostics API

**Medimate-AI** is a smart healthcare assistant powered by AI. It provides **multimodal diagnostic support** using clinical text, lab reports, voice transcriptions, and X-ray images.

This project is built using **FastAPI**, Hugging Face Transformers, and state-of-the-art deep learning models. It demonstrates my ability to integrate multiple AI modalities into a unified API system â€“ an essential skill for data science, ML engineering, and AI-driven product roles.
